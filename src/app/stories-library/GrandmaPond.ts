    para1: `"Hurry up Timmy, we are getting late!" Timmy's sister yelled, jumping up and down next to her brother's bed. Their mother was taking them to visit grandma at the farm over the weekend. The children were very excited. Grandmother always baked delicious
                      chocolate cupcakes for them and they could not wait to stuff themselves with them.`,
    para2: `As Timmy's mother drove through the gates of the farm, Timmy caught sight of a pond a short distance from grandma's house. "Look, mum!" Timmy pointed
                      excitedly. "I don't remember seeing a pond near grandma's house. Can I go and see it?". He asked, barely able to contain his excitement. "Yes you can Timmy, but right after you greet grandma," his mum answered calmly.`,
    para3: `Later that day Timmy went to see the pond. He saw a lot of things around it too. There were frogs jumping around on green water lillies, tadpoles swimming under the smelly green water, empty tins floating on top, and dragonflies
                      hovering lazily all over the pond. A huge heap of old tyres and junk dumped by naughty boys lay next to the pond.`,
    para4: `"Yuck!" said Timmy. "This pond is disgusting."`,
