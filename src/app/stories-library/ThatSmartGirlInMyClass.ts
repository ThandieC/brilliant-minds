  title: `That Smart Girl In My Class`,
  description: 'She was the most interesting kid in my class.',
  storyBody: {
    para1: `Zoe was a really smart sixth grader. She could work out any Math problem
    faster than any of us. She could memorize the multiplication
    tables and recite them like they were her own name. She did not need a Science Textbook to
     redo any of the experiments we had done before. We usually said her brain was like a sponge,
     it absorbed and remembered everything she learned.`,

    para2: ` Apart from being so intelligent, Zoe was so beautiful. She was tall and slim, light skinned
    with shiny brown hair, and little dimples on her cheeks. She had bright white perfectly shaped
    teeth that made her brilliant smile imprint a lasting impression on anyone, especially boys of course.
     Her uniform was just the right size, and cascaded down her body curves in such an immaculate way she got stares
     all around as she cruised softly down the school corridors.`,

    para3: `Zoe was usually the last student to arrive in class, I do not
      know if it was deliberate so everyone could admire her as she walked in and flashed a bright white shy smile before apologizing
      to the teacher in her soft sweet voice, or maybe she had real delays that she could not avoid. But either way,
       she hardly ever got detention like the rest of us. All the teachers liked her; for her beauty, or for her
       intelligence, I do not know.`,

    para4: `Though Zoe was such an outstandingly intelligent and beautiful girl, she had hardly any friends. No one
    really liked sitting next to her in class or playing with her outside. Everyone thought she was uncomfortably too quiet, not the kind
    of person you would like for a buddy. She was therefore always lonely, and that did not
     seem to bother her at all. Her real friends were here books, and the Science Lab of course. Though I admired her so much, I also
     felt sorry for her. Everyone needs a friend, no matter how smart, or quiet, they are. But Zoe seemed to live in her own world, where she was happy alone.`,
