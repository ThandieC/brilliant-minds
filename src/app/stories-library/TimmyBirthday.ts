    para1: `"It's my birthday today." Timmy said to Lisa, his sister. "I'm so excited. I wonder what mum and dad have planned for me this year."`,
    para2: `"Oh! It's your birthday!?" Lisa asked surprised. "I did not realize. I only remember my own birthdays."`,
    para3: `That means you did not get me any present then." He mourned. "Well, at least mum and dad always remember everyone's birthday," Timmy sighed sadly.`,
    para4: `"Hey Timmy, let's go and play football at the park." Timmy's friend James shouted as he walked towards Timmy's house. "I can't wait to beat that
                  team that beat us last time."`,
    para5: `"I can't go today," Timmy answered, grinning to himself. "It's my birthday remember!. I don't want to get all dirty and messed up on my birthday."`,
    para6: `"It's your birthday!?" James asked surprised, his mouth and eyes wide open. "I completely forgot." He said. "It's okay. Lisa forgot too," Timmy muttered sadly. "But at least mum and dad never forget."`,
    para7: `"Mum and dad never forget what?" asked Timmy's mum, pouring some milk for the cat. "Lisa and James forgot it's my birthday today." Timmy answered. "It's your birthday
                        today!? What? How did we forget?" his mum stated in surprise, looking at her husband. `,
    para8: `"I forgot too. Sorry Timmy," his father muttered with a very sad face. Timmy just turned around and rushed up the stairs to his bedroom, locked
                        himself in, and burrowed his face into the pillows, determined not to let anybody hear his quiet sob.`,
    para9: `A little while later Timmy heard his father's footsteps as he walked up the stair to his room. "Timmy, can you come down here. I need some help to repair the garage door," he shouted. Timmy dragged himself out of his
                        room and unwillingly followed his father down the stairs, all the way through the living room and out through the front door to the garage. "It's so dark in here. Switch on the lights please Timmy," his father said as he opened the
                        garage door and moved to the side to let Timmy go in first. Timmy switched on the lights and what! The garage was filled with Timmy's family and friends who all jumped out of their hiding spots and yelled,"Surprise!" while rushing forward
                        and plastering delighted Timmy with lots of hugs and kisses.`,
    para10: `It was a surprise indeed; his family and friends, the balloons, the decorations, the presents, the food, and the big birthday cake with a pretty number 'TEN' written on top! "Wow!" Timmy said to himself as he crept into his bed later that
                        night, still unable to erase the gigantic smile painted across his face. "This was the best birthday ever!"`,
