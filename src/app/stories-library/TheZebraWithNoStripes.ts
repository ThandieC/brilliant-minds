  storyBody: {
    para1: `"Woo, what a night!" yawned Zippy the Zebra as he stretched out his neck over the tall grass and
    looked around. The sun was up and shining ever so brighlty in a spotless blue sky.
      A soft breeze gently combed though the tall brown savanna grass that Zippy called his home. His mom was
      lazily munching grass nearby, occasionally stopping and gazing around. She was always on the lookout for
      trouble. The day was beautiful, everything was perfect. Well, perfect except for the fact that Zippy did not
      look anything like the rest of his zebra tribe.`,

    para2: `Zippy leaped up out of the grass and stretched out his four legs. Then he turned and spotted a group of
    animals playfully running around and munching on grass some distance away. She sighed and slumped back to the ground.`,

    para3: `"What is wrong Zippy? You look so sad." Zippy's mum asked, a mouthful of grass hanging down from her mouth.`,

    para4: `"If only I wasn't different. If only I looked just like all the other zebras." Zippy moaned. Unlike other
     zebras, Zippy's coat was all black without a single white stripe.`,

    para5: `"Zippy, you are perfect just the way you are." His mum said, walking over to him and hugging him with her neck.
     "Everyone is unique and special in their own way. Our differences make us even more special."`,

    para6: `"If that is the case, then why isn't anyone interested in playing with me. Everyone thinks I'm dull and stupid. No one
     will ever want to play with me. They will just laugh at my plain black coat." Zippy continued his moarning.`,

    para7: `"Why don't you go out there and try playing with others. You might just be surprised." His mum said, as she walked off towards
      the water hole.`,

    para8: `Zippy quietly slept under the shade of an Amarula tree, sorrowfully watching the other animals play while processing
     in his mind what his mother had just said to him. Then, without giving it a second thought, he leaped up and trotted over
     to the other animals, and stopped just as he raeched them.`,

    para9: `"Hey, Zippy! Finally you join us." said the other animals excitedly. "Come over and play. Why don't you ever play with us?"`,

    para10: `Zippy was surprised. Everyone was excited to have him around. No one even seemed to care about or notice his different coat. Zippy
     ran and played and munched grass with his new friends the whole morning, and later they went off together to the
     local water hole to quench their thirst. It turned out to be the best day ever for Zippy, and he learned a wonderful lesson
     that day; that everyone was different and special in their own unique way.`,
